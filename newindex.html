<h1>About Sriya</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Sriya!</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an incoming Junior at UConn majoring in CogSci and minoring in Comp Sci</p>
    <p>CogSci or Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of the psychology, neuroscience, anthropology, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science, specifically AI. I find it super interesting because it relates the functioning of the mind to computer models. It's really interesting to see the paralells in between how our minds think and how AI systems are built based off our minds functions.</p>
<h2>My KWK Journey</h2>
<p>I did my first KWK (WebDev) workshop when I was an incoming senior in highschool (almost four years ago). This was my first ever experience coding and it was such an enjoyable one. I learned more than technical knowledge, I learned how to apply it in the real world and how to make connections for the future. To this day it has been one of my best experiences in a coding environment.</p>
<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<p>I love to read, the book I'm reading right now is "A Picture of Dorian Gray" and it's really good so far, I would recommend it!</p>
<p>I write articles for Her Campus blogs in my free time.</p>
<p>I always paint my toenails maroon (because thats the only nail polish color I have).</p>
